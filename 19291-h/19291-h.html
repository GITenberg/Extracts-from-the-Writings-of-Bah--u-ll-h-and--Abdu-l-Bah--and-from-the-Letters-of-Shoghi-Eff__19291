<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Friends,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have been asked by the Universal House of Justice to
send you the enclosed copy of a compilation on scholarship prepared
recently at its request by the Research Department at the Bahá’í
World Centre.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the hope of the House of Justice that a study of
this compilation will serve as a stimulus and a guide in the further
development of Bahá’í scholarship, and that the
unique features of this vital aspect of Bahá’í
activity will be clarified through a perusal of its contents.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice calls upon the members of the
community of the Greatest Name, young and old, men and women alike,
to strive to develop and offer to humanity a new model of scholarly
activity along the lines set out in this compilation, animated by the
spirit of inquiry into the limitless meaning of the Divine Teachings.
This scholarly endeavour should be characterized by the welcome it
offers to all who wish to be involved in it, each in his or her own
way, by mutual encouragement and cooperation among its participants,
and by the respect accorded to distinguished accomplishment and
outstanding achievement. The spirit and approach should be far
removed from the arrogance, contention, and exclusiveness which have
too often sullied the name of scholarship in the wider society, and
which have created barriers to the sound development of this worthy
pursuit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is left to your discretion to determine the use you
should make of the enclosed material.</p>

incumbent upon everyone to acquire it. Such arts and material means
as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Knowledge is as wings to man’s life, and a ladder
for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The
knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit
the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and
end with words. Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen
on the peoples of the world.... In truth, knowledge is a veritable
treasure for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of
exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him. Thus hath the Tongue of
Grandeur spoken in this Most Great Prison.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All blessings are divine in origin, but none can be
compared with this power of intellectual investigation and research,
which is an eternal gift producing fruits of unending delight. Man is
ever partaking of these fruits. All other blessings are temporary;
this is an everlasting possession. Even sovereignty has its
limitations and overthrow; this is a kingship and dominion which none
may usurp or destroy. Briefly, it is an eternal blessing and divine
bestowal, the supreme gift of God to man. Therefore, you should put
forward your most earnest efforts toward the acquisition of science
and arts. The greater your attainment, the higher your standard in
the divine purpose. The man of science is perceiving and endowed with
vision, whereas he who is ignorant and neglectful of this development
is blind. The investigating mind is attentive, alive; the callous and
indifferent mind is deaf and dead. A scientific man is a true index
and representative of humanity, for through processes of inductive
reasoning and research he is informed of all that appertains to
humanity, its status, conditions and happenings. He studies the human
body politic, understands social problems and weaves the web and
texture of civilization. In fact, science may be likened to a mirror
wherein the infinite forms and images of existing things are revealed
and reflected. It is the very foundation of all individual and
national development. Without this basis of investigation,
development is impossible. Therefore, seek with diligent endeavour
the knowledge and attainment of all that lies within the power of
this wonderful bestowal.</p>

he can in no wise be regarded as possessed of true knowledge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...there are those famed and accomplished men of
learning, possessed of praiseworthy qualities and vast erudition, who
lay hold on the strong handle of the fear of God and keep to the ways
of salvation. In the mirror of their minds the forms of transcendent
realities are reflected, and the lamp of their inner vision derives
its light from the sun of universal knowledge. They are busy by night
and by day with meticulous research into such sciences as are
profitable to mankind, and they devote themselves to the training of
students of capacity. It is certain that to their discerning taste,
the proffered treasures of kings would not compare with a single drop
of the waters of knowledge, and mountains of gold and silver could
not outweigh the successful solution of a difficult problem. To them,
the delights that lie outside their work are only toys for children,
and the cumbersome load of unnecessary possessions is only good for
the ignorant and base. Content, like the birds, they give thanks for
a handful of seeds, and the song of their wisdom dazzles the minds of
the world’s most wise....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...the happiness and greatness, the rank and station,
the pleasure and peace, of an individual have never consisted in his
personal wealth, but rather in his excellent character, his high
resolve, the breadth of his learning, and his ability to solve
difficult problems....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For every thing, however, God has created a sign and
symbol, and established standards and tests by which it may be known.
The spiritually learned must be characterized by both inward and
outward perfections; they must possess a good character, an
enlightened nature, a pure intent, as well as intellectual power,
brilliance and discernment, intuition, discretion and foresight,
temperance, reverance, and a heartfelt fear of God. For an unlit
candle, however great in diameter and tall, is no better than a
barren palm tree or a pile of dead wood....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An authoritative Tradition states: “As for him who
is one of the learned:<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
he must guard himself, defend his faith, oppose his passions and obey
the commandments of his Lord. It is then the duty of the people to
pattern themselves after him.”</p>

should be familiar with the different sciences and branches of study,
Shoghi Effendi wishes me to inform you that both Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have given a very high position
to men of culture and knowledge and Bahá’u’lláh
says in one of His Tablets that respect shown to such people is
incumbent upon all Bahá’ís. Furthermore there is
no doubt that familiarity with different branches of study widens
one’s point of view and we can then understand and realize the
significance of the Bahá’í Movement and its
principles much more.</p>

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">14: “At this early stage in
the development of the Faith, it would not...”</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this early stage in the development of the Faith, it
would not be useful to propound a highly restrictive definition of
the term “Bahá’í scholarship”. In a
letter written on behalf of the House of Justice to an Association
for Bahá’í Studies recently, it is stated that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice advises you not to attempt to
define too narrowly the form that Bahá’í
scholarship should take, or the approach that scholars should adopt.
Rather should you strive to develop within your Association respect
for a wide range of approaches and endeavours. No doubt there will be
some Bahá’ís who will wish to work in isolation,
while others will desire consultation and collaboration with those
having similar interests. Your aim should be to promote an atmosphere
of mutual respect and tolerance within which will be included
scholars whose principal interest is in theological issues as well as
those scholars whose interests lie in relating the insights provided
by the Bahá’í teachings to contemporary thought
in the arts and sciences.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar diversity should characterize the endeavours
pursued by Bahá’í scholars, accommodating their
interests and skills as well as the needs of the Faith. The course of
world events, the development of new trends of thought and the
extension of the teaching work all tend to highlight attractive and
beneficial areas to which Bahá’í scholars might
well direct their attention. Likewise, the expansion of the
activities of the Bahá’í International Community
in its relationship with United Nations agencies and other
international bodies creates attractive opportunities for scholars to
make a direct and highly valued contribution to the enhancement of
the prestige of the Faith and to its proclamation within an
influential and receptive stratum of society. As the Bahá’í
community continues to emerge inexorably from obscurity, it will be
confronted by enemies, from both within and without, whose aim will
be to malign and misrepresent its principles, so that its admirers
might be disillusioned and the faith of its adherents might be
shaken; Bahá’í scholars have a vital role to play
in the defence of the Faith through their contribution to
anticipatory measures and their response to defamatory accusations
levelled against the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, there should be room within the scope of Bahá’í
scholarship to accommodate not only those who are interested in
theological issues and in the historical origins of the Faith, but
also those who are interested in relating the Bahá’í
Teachings to their field of academic or professional interest, as
well as those believers who may lack formal academic qualifications
but who have, through their perceptive study of the Teachings,
acquired insights which are of interest to others....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice wishes to avoid use of the terms
“Bahá’í scholarship” and “Bahá’í
scholars” in an exclusive sense, which would effectively
establish a demarcation between those admitted into this category and
those denied entrance to it. It is clear that such terms are
relative, and that what is a worthy scholarly endeavour by a Bahá’í,
when compared to the activities of those with whom he is in contact,
may well be regarded as of vastly lesser significance when measured
against the accomplishments of the outstanding scholars which the
Faith has produced. The House of Justice seeks the creation of a
Bahá’í community in which the members encourage
each other, where there is respect for accomplishment, and a common
realization that every one is, in his or her own way, seeking to
acquire a deeper understanding of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
and to contribute to the advancement of the Faith.</p>

Consequently, how can it be said to oppose knowledge? God forbid!
Nay, for God, knowledge is the most glorious gift of man and the most
noble of human perfections. To oppose knowledge is ignorant, and he
who detests knowledge and science is not a man, but rather an animal
without intelligence. For knowledge is light, life, felicity,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is therefore urgent that beneficial articles and
books be written, clearly and definitely establishing what the
present-day requirements of the people are, and what will conduce to
the happiness and advancement of society. These should be published
and spread throughout the nation, so that at least the leaders among
the people should become, to some degree, awakened, and arise to
exert themselves along those lines which will lead to their abiding
honour. The publication of high thoughts is the dynamic power in the
arteries of life; it is the very soul of the world. Thoughts are
boundless sea, and the effects and varying conditions of existence
are as the separate forms and individual limits of the waves; not
until the sea boils up will the waves rise and scatter their pearls
of knowledge on the shore of life....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Public opinion must be directed toward whatever is
worthy of this day, and this is impossible except through the use of
adequate arguments and the adducing of clear, comprehensive and
conclusive proofs. For the helpless masses know nothing of the world,
and while there is no doubt that they seek and long for their own
happiness, yet ignorance like a heavy veil shuts them away from
it....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, furthermore, a vital necessity to establish
schools.... If necessary, education should even be made compulsory.
Until the nerves and arteries of the nation stir into life, every
measure that is attempted will prove vain; for the people are as the
human body, and determination and the will to struggle are as the
soul, and a soulless body does not move.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The further emergence of the Faith from obscurity is
reflected in distinctive ways. In learned circles, in reference works
and in the media, the Faith is increasingly being referred to as a
“principal” or “major” world religion.... The
exposure of influential segments of the public to Bahá’í
ideas in such areas as peace, the environment, status of women,
education and literacy, has induced a response which increasingly
calls upon the Bahá’ís to participate with others
in a range of projects associated with governments or with
non-governmental organizations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, such exposure is creating in the public mind
the realization that the Faith has answers to current problems and
thus the expectation that the Bahá’í community
should take a more active part in public affairs....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...Bahá’í projects of social and
economic development have greatly multiplied and brought much credit
to the community in the examples of the power of group initiative and
voluntary consultative action that have been set in numerous
places.... Some projects have been so distinguished in their
achievements as to be given public notice through the citations and
awards of governments and international non-governmental agencies.</p>

this properly they will need a firm foundation of scientific and
literary training which fortunately they are obtaining. It is just as
important for the Bahá’í young boys and girls to
become properly educated in colleges of high standing as it is to be
spiritually developed. The mental as well as the spiritual side of
the youth has to be developed before he can serve the Cause

about the purpose of human life, the nature of the human being and
the proper conduct of human lives, is divinely revealed and therefore
true. However, it will inevitably take time for you not only to study
the Bahá’í teachings so that you clearly
understand them, but also to work out how they modify your
professional concepts. This is, of course, not an unusual predicament
for a scientist. How often in the course of research is a factor
discovered which requires a revolution in thinking over a wide field
of human endeavour. You must be guided in each case by your own
professional knowledge and judgement as illuminated by your growing
knowledge of the Bahá’í teachings; undoubtedly
you will find that your own understanding of the human problems dealt
with in your work will change and develop and you will see new and
improved ways of helping the people who come to you. Psychology is
still a very young and inexact science, and as the years go by Bahá’í
psychologists, who know from the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
the true pattern of human life, will be able to make great strides in
the development of this science, and will help profoundly in the
alleviation of human suffering.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the Bahá’í community grows it
will acquire experts in numerous fields—both by Bahá’ís
becoming experts and by experts becoming Bahá’ís.
As these experts bring their knowledge and skill to the service of
the community and, even more, as they transform their various
disciplines by bringing to bear upon them the light of the Divine
Teachings, problem after problem now disrupting society will be
answered....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Paralleling this process, Bahá’í
institutional life will also be developing, and as it does so the
Assemblies will draw increasingly upon scientific and expert
knowledge—whether of Bahá’ís or of
non-Bahá’ís—to assist in solving the
problems of their communities.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In time great Bahá’í institutions of
learning, great international and national projects for the
betterment of human life will be inaugurated and flourish.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed, let them [the Bahá’í youth]
welcome with confidence the challenges awaiting them. Imbued with
this excellence and a corresponding humility, with tenacity and a
loving servitude, today’s youth must move towards the front
ranks of the professions, trades, arts and crafts which are necessary
to the further progress of humankind—this to ensure that the
spirit of the Cause will cast its illumination on all these important
areas of human endeavour. Moreover, while aiming at mastering the
unifying concepts and swiftly advancing technologies of this era of
communications, they can, indeed they must, also guarantee the
transmittal to the future of those skills which will preserve the
marvelous, indispensable achievements of the past. The transformation
which is to occur in the functioning of society will certainly depend
to a great extent on the effectiveness of the preparations the youth
make for the world they will inherit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice recognizes that the questions you
raise, concerning the offer of newly enrolled professionals to share
their views with the Bahá’í community, are of
vital and timely importance, especially as the Faith emerges from
obscurity and increasing numbers of professionals from all walks of
life are attracted to its Teachings. The process of integrating these
experts into Bahá’í communities as well-grounded
believers and tapping their potential as promoters and supporters of
the Cause will require patient and loving guidance by Bahá’í
institutions. A great challenge will be to avoid undue disruption of
this process of integration by abandoning such persons to the
insensitive attitudes still present in communities not yet broadly
diverse or accustomed to dealing with all ranks of society.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scholars and professionals are well accustomed to
encountering new facts in the course of their research which require
them to adjust previous thinking on various aspects of their
discipline. In the case of their deepening in the Teachings of the
Faith it naturally takes time for them to study and absorb so many
new concepts. They must be assisted to acquire, as quickly as
possible, profound knowledge of the Teachings. Gradually this
knowledge will shed new light on their previous views. At the same
time, Bahá’í communities will need to develop
greater tolerance toward ideas that may not coincide with their
current understanding, and remain open to new insights....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Newly enrolled professionals and other experts provide a
great resource for the development of Bahá’í
scholarship. It is hoped that, as they attain a deeper grasp of the
Teachings and their significance, they will be able to assist Bahá’í
communities in correlating the beliefs of the Faith with the current
thoughts and problems of the world. In some instances Bahá’ís
of a particular profession have come together in special conferences
or organized themselves into an association for this purpose. This
also allows them to support one another as Bahá’ís
and to take advantage of their professional status to promote the
interests of the Faith. Current examples of professional associations
of this type are the Bahá’í Justice Society and
the Bahá’í Medical Association, both in the
United States. Special encouragement should therefore be given to
believers of unusual capacity to consecrate their abilities to the
service of the Cause through the unique contribution they can make to
this rapidly developing field of Bahá’í
endeavour.</p>

river floweth into the mighty Sea, and draweth from God’s

teacher is as a shoreless ocean, every pupil a prodigal fountain of
knowledge. If, then, the pursuit of knowledge leadeth to the beauty
of Him Who is the object of all knowledge, how excellent that goal;
but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding
grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth
on error and indifference to God.</p>

human plane, for science is the discoverer of realities. It is of two
kinds: material and spiritual. Material science is the investigation
of natural phenomena; divine science is the discovery and realization
of spiritual verities. The world of humanity must acquire both. A
bird has two wings; it cannot fly with one. Material and spiritual
science are the two wings of human uplift and attainment. Both are
necessary—one the natural, the other supernatural; one
material, the other divine. By the divine we mean the discovery of
the mysteries of God, the comprehension of spiritual realities, the
wisdom of God, inner significances of the heavenly religions and
foundation of the law.</p>

thinkers, there is an immense difference. We must never, under any
circumstances, confuse the two.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bahá’u’lláh has said that
learning can be the veil between the soul of man and the eternal
truth; in other words, between man and the knowledge of God. We have
seen that many people who become very advanced in the study of modern
physical sciences are led to deny God, and to deny His Prophets. That
does not mean that God and the Prophets have not existed and do not
exist. It only means that knowledge has become a veil between their
hearts and the light of God.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as there is a fundamental difference between divine
Revelation itself and the understanding that believers have of it, so
also there is a basic distinction between scientific fact and
reasoning on the one hand and the conclusions or theories of
scientists on the other. There is, and can be, no conflict between
true religion and true science: true religion is revealed by God,
while it is through true science that the mind of man “discovers
the realities of things and becomes cognizant of their peculiarities
and effects, and of the qualities and properties of beings” and
“comprehendeth the abstract by the aid of the concrete”.
However, whenever a statement is made through the lens of human
understanding it is thereby limited, for human understanding is
limited; and where there is limitation there is the possibility of
error; and where there is error, conflicts can arise. For example, at
the present time many people are convinced that it is unscientific to
believe in God, but, as human enlightenment progresses, the
scientists and philosophers of the future will not be, in the words
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “deniers of the Prophets,
ignorant of spiritual susceptibilities, deprived of the heavenly
bounties and without belief in the supernatural”.</p>

of God and His Teachings, with the searching and intelligent study of
the Teachings and history of the Faith which those Teachings
themselves enjoin, is a particular strength of this Dispensation. In
past Dispensations the believers have tended to divide into two
mutually antagonistic groups: those who held blindly to the letter of
the Revelation, and those who questioned and doubted everything. Like
all extremes, both these can lead into error. The beloved Guardian
has written that “The Bahá’í Faith ...
enjoins upon its followers the primary duty of an unfettered search
after truth....” Bahá’ís are called upon to
follow the Faith with intelligence and understanding. Inevitably
believers will commit errors as they strive to rise to this degree of
maturity, and this calls for forbearance and humility on the part of
all concerned, so that such matters do not cause disunity or discord
among the friends.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice suggests that the issues raised in
your letter might best be considered in light of the statements in
the Bahá’í Writings which disclose the
relationship between the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
and the knowledge which is acquired as a result of scholarly
endeavours. Bahá’u’lláh asserts that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unveiled and unconcealed, this Wronged One hath, at all
times, proclaimed before the face of all the peoples of the world
that which will serve as the key for unlocking the doors of sciences,
of arts, of knowledge, of well-being, of prosperity and wealth....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident that the Bahá’í
Writings illuminate all areas of human endeavour and all academic
disciplines. Those who have been privileged to recognize the station
of Bahá’u’lláh have the bounty of access to
a Revelation which casts light upon all aspects of thought and
inquiry, and are enjoined to use the understanding which they obtain
from their immersion in the Holy Writings to advance the interests of
the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those believers with the capacity and opportunity to do
so have repeatedly been encouraged in their pursuit of academic
studies by which they are not only equipped to render much needed
services to the Faith, but are also provided with the means to
acquire a profound insight into the meaning and the implications of
the Bahá’í Teachings. They discover also that the
perceptions gained from a deeper understanding of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh clarify the subjects of their
academic inquiry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is useful to review a number of statements written by
Shoghi Effendi on this subject. To a believer who had completed
advanced academic studies in a subject related to the Teachings the
Guardian stated, in a letter written on his behalf:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is hoped that all the Bahá’í
students will follow the noble example you have set before them and
will, henceforth, be led to investigate and analyse the principles of
the Faith and to correlate them with the modern aspects of philosophy
and science. Every intelligent and thoughtful young Bahá’í
should always approach the Cause in this way, for therein lies the
very essence of the principle of independent investigation of truth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he was informed of the enrolment of a scientist in
the Faith, the response set out in the letter written on his behalf
was:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We need very much the sound, sane, element of thinking
which a scientifically trained mind has to offer. When such
intellectual powers are linked to deep faith a tremendous teaching
potential is created....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His secretary wrote, on another occasion, that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá’ís
(who asked his advice, and in general also) to study history,
economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant with all the
progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today, and so that
they could correlate these to the Bahá’í
teachings. What he wants the Bahá’ís to do is to
study more, not to study less. The more general knowledge, scientific
and otherwise, they possess, the better. Likewise he is constantly
urging them to really study the Bahá’í teachings
more deeply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the simultaneous endeavour to pursue their studies
and to delve deeply into the Bahá’í Teachings,
believers are enjoined to maintain a keen awareness that the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is the standard
of truth against which all other views and conclusions are to be
measured. They are urged to be modest about their accomplishments,
and to bear in mind always the statement of Bahá’u’lláh
that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The heart must needs therefore be cleansed from the idle
sayings of men, and sanctified from every earthly affection, so that
it may discover the hidden meaning of divine inspiration, and become
the treasury of the mysteries of divine knowledge.</p>

interest for a Bahá’í who is looking how the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In response to your letter of ... in which you seek
guidance on the question of chosen professions vis-á-vis the
statement of Bahá’u’lláh concerning
sciences which begin in words and end in mere words and the pursuit
of study in pure mathematics and the classics, the Universal House of
Justice has instructed us to share with you an excerpt from a letter
to an individual believer written in 1947 on behalf of the beloved
Guardian: Philosophy, as you will study it and later teach it, is
certainly not one of the sciences that begins and ends in words.
Fruitless excursions into metaphysical hair-splittings is meant, not
a sound branch of learning like philosophy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these words the Guardian has enunciated the general
principle. Turning to the specific instance of the science of pure
mathematics, the reference in the Eleventh Glad Tidings (Bahá’í
World Faith, p. 195) regarding such sciences as are profitable, which
lead and conduce to the elevation of mankind,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
must be placed in the context of the meaning of sciences as employed
by the Manifestation. Bahá’u’lláh’s
comment about sciences which begin and end in mere words does not
apply to the systematic study of natural phenomena in order to
discover the laws of order in the physical universe, an order which
mathematics seeks to explore. Pure mathematics frequently has
application in practical matters, such as, for example, group theory
or the study of fundamental particles.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for classical studies, we are to share with you the
following excerpt from a letter dated 30 November 1932 written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual who had asked a question
about the skills of story writing and whether such occupation would
be classed as those sciences that begin and end in words”.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What Bahá’u’lláh meant
primarily with “sciences that begin and end in words” are
those theological treatises and commentaries that encumber the human
mind rather than help it to attain the truth. The students would
devote their life to their study but still attain no where.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bahá’u’lláh surely never meant
to include story-writing under such a category; and shorthand and
typewriting are both most useful talents, very necessary in our
present social and economic life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What you could do, and should do, is to use your stories
to become a source of inspiration and guidance for those who read
them. With such a means at your disposal you can spread the spirit
and teachings of the Cause; you can show the evils that exist in
society, as well as the way they can be remedied. If you possess a
real talent in writing you should consider it as given by God and
exert your efforts to use it for the betterment of society.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice hopes that you will be able to
satisfy your friends on these matters and encourage them to prepare
for their Bahá’í service and be able to
contribute to the welfare of humanity.</p>

their limited understanding, to define doctrines where definition was
beyond their power, to explain mysteries which only the wisdom and
experience of a later age would make comprehensible, to argue that
something was true because it appeared desirable and necessary. Such

youth will often find themselves in the unusual and slightly
embarrassing position of having a more profound insight into a
subject than their instructors. The Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
throw light on so many aspects of human life and knowledge that a
Bahá’í must learn, earlier than most, to weigh
the information that is given to him rather than to accept it
blindly. A Bahá’í has the advantage of the divine
Revelation for this Age, which shines like a searchlight on so many
problems that baffle modern thinkers; he must therefore develop the
ability to learn everything from those around him, showing proper
humility before his teachers, but always relating what he hears to
the Bahá’í teachings, for they will enable him to
sort out the gold from the dross of human error.</p>

remembering that all Bahá’ís are but students of
the Faith, ever striving to understand the Teachings more clearly and
to apply them more faithfully, and none can claim to have a perfect
understanding of this Revelation. At the same time all believers, and
scholars in particular, should remember the many warnings in the
Writings against the fomenting of discord among the friends. It is
the duty of the institutions of the Faith to guard the community
against such dangers.... [I]t cannot be denied that some of the
statements that have been made recently in the name of Bahá’í
scholarship by certain individuals have betrayed an intemperance, and
a lack of appreciation of many of the fundamental teachings of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House of Justice feels that Bahá’í
scholars must beware of the temptations of intellectual pride.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has warned the friends in the West
that they would be subjected to intellectual tests, and the Guardian
reminded them of this warning. There are many aspects of western
thinking which have been exalted to a status of unassailable
principle in the general mind, that time may well show to have been
erroneous or, at least, only partially true. Any Bahá’í
who rises to eminence in academic circles will be exposed to the
powerful influence of such thinking. One of the problems of modern
times is the degree to which the different disciplines have become
specialized and isolated from one another. Thinkers are now faced
with a challenge to achieve a synthesis, or at least a coherent
correlation, of the vast amount of knowledge that has been acquired
during the past century. The Bahá’ís must be
aware of this factor and of the moderation and all-embracing nature
of this Revelation....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the application of the social laws of the Faith, most
of the also from the actions of those who, while careful to observe
the letter of the difficulties can be seen to arise not only from
outright disobedience, but law, try to go as far as it will permit
them away from the spirit which lies at its heart. A similar tendency
can be noted among some Bahá’í scholars. The
great advances in knowledge and understanding in the vital field of
Bahá’í scholarship will be made by those who,
while well versed in their subjects and adhering to the principles of
research, are also thoroughly imbued with love for the Faith and the
determination to grow in the comprehension of its teachings.</p>

accepted methods of comprehension—that is to say,...”</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are only four accepted methods of
comprehension—that is to say, the realities of things are
understood by these four methods.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first method is by the senses—that is to say,
all that the eye, the ear, the taste, the smell, the touch perceive
is understood by this method. Today this method is considered the
most perfect by all the European philosophers: they say that the
principal method of gaining knowledge is through the senses; they
consider it supreme, although it is imperfect, for it commits errors.
For example, the greatest of the senses is the power of sight.... The
sight believes the earth to be motionless and sees the sun in motion,
and in many similar cases it makes mistakes. Therefore, we cannot
trust it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second is the method of reason, which was that of
the ancient philosophers, the pillars of wisdom; this is the method
of the understanding. They proved things by reason and hold firmly to
logical proofs; all their arguments are arguments of reason.
Notwithstanding this, they differed greatly, and their opinions were
contradictory. They even changed their views—that is to say,
during twenty years they would prove the existence of a thing by
logical arguments, and afterward they would deny it by logical
arguments—so much so that Plato at first logically proved the
immobility of the earth and the movement of the sun; later by logical
arguments he proved that the sun was the stationary center, and that
the earth was moving.... Therefore, it is evident that the method of
reason is not perfect, for the differences of the ancient
philosophers, the want of stability and the variations of their
opinions, prove this. For if it were perfect, all ought to be united
in their ideas and agreed in their opinions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third method of understanding is by tradition—that
is, through the text of the Holy Scriptures—for people say, “In
the Old and New Testaments, God spoke thus.” This method
equally is not perfect, because the traditions are understood by the
reason. As the reason itself is liable to err, how can it be said
that in interpreting the meaning of the traditions it will not err,
for it is possible for it to make mistakes, and certainty cannot be
attained. This is the method of the religious leaders; whatever they
understand and comprehend from the text of the books is that which
their reason understands from the text, and not necessarily the real
truth; for the reason is like a balance, and the meanings contained
in the text of the Holy Books are like the thing which is weighed. If
the balance is untrue, how can the weight be ascertained?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Know then: that which is in the hands of people, that
which they believe, is liable to error. For, in proving or disproving
a thing, if a proof is brought forward which is taken from the
evidence of our senses, this method, as has become evident, is not
perfect; if the proofs are intellectual, the same is true; or if they
are traditional, such proofs also are not perfect. Therefore, there
is no standard in the hands of people upon which we can rely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the bounty of the Holy Spirit gives the true method
of comprehension which is infallible and indubitable. This is through
the help of the Holy Spirit which comes to man, and this is the
condition in which certainty can alone be attained.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The concern was expressed that many of the friends,
holding that there is only one “correct” view of the
history and teachings of the Faith, react critically to unfamiliar
views. This has already been covered in statements made by the
Universal House of Justice itself, for example that on pages 88–89
of “Wellspring of Guidance”. As you point out in your
letter, divine Revelation is infallible and proceeds from an
all-encompassing knowledge of the Truth, but when individual Bahá’ís
attempt to apply Sacred Texts to any specific problem or situation
they do so using their own minds which are of limited understanding.
Thus, just as people can differ from one another in their use of
reason in making deductions from available evidence, so they can also
differ in their understanding and application of a passage of divine
Revelation. The Bahá’í principle of the harmony
between science and religion requires, as you say, that a Bahá’í
scholar must use his intelligence to arrive at a solution of a
specific problem if there is an apparent conflict between a Sacred
Text and other evidence; and also he must accept the fact that some
problems may defy his comprehension....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By conveying the comments of the Research Department on
the ... Seminar<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
the House of Justice did not intend to imply that there was only one
valid methodology for Bahá’í historians to
follow. It merely wished to alert Bahá’í scholars
to the dangers that are inherent in the paths that some of them are
following at the present time. Historical research is largely a
matter of evaluating evidence and deducing probabilities. Historical
evidence, moreover, is always fragmentary, and may also be
accidentally erroneous or even intentionally fabricated. The House of
Justice realizes that you are fully aware of this, but it stresses
the point because it does not see how a Bahá’í
historian can in all honesty claim to be a faithful believer on the
one hand and, on the other, challenge in his writings the veracity
and honour of the Central Figures of the Faith or of its Guardian.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that the Faith, as the Guardian states,
“enjoins upon its followers the primary duty of an unfettered
search after truth”, should reassure any aspiring Bahá’í
historian that there can be no question of any requirement to distort
history in the so-called “interests” of the Faith. On the
contrary, the combination of profound faith and freedom of thought is
one of the great strengths of the Bahá’í
religion. It does, however, place a great responsibility upon Bahá’í
historians to put forward their views and conclusions with moderation
and due humility. In this connection one of the Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh states:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou hast written that one of the friends hath composed
a treatise. This was mentioned in the Holy Presence, and this is what
was revealed in response: Great care should be exercised that
whatever is written in these days doth not cause dissension, and
invite the objection of the people. Whatever the friends of the one
true God say in these days is listened to by the people of the world.
It hath been revealed in the Lawḥ-i-Hikmat: “The
unbelievers have inclined their ears towards Us in order to hear that
which might enable them to cavil against God, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting.” Whatever is written should not transgress the
bounds of tact and wisdom, and in the words used there should lie hid
the property of milk, so that the children of the world may be
nurtured therewith, and attain maturity. We have said in the past
that one word hath the influence of spring and causeth hearts to
become fresh and verdant, while another is like unto blight which
causeth the blossoms and flowers to wither. God grant that authors
among the friends will write in such a way as would be acceptable</p>

dangers of taking for granted the a priori assumptions of modern
non-Bahá’í scholars and of allowing their
thinking and their understanding of the Faith to be limited by
criteria which they themselves, as Bahá’ís, would
know to be in error. It was also the hope of the House of Justice
that Bahá’í scholars would realize the
significance of the manner in which they express themselves, and that
they would guard against use of the proud and scornful language with
which some had been publicly referring to their fellow believers who,
nevertheless, were devotedly trying to serve the Faith of God.</p>

Himself used such a method. The danger Bahá’í
scholars must avoid is the distortion of religious truth, almost
forcibly at times, to make it conform to understandings and
perceptions current in the scientific world. True Bahá’í
scholars should guard against this. In a letter to a National
Spiritual Assembly dated 21 July 1968, the House of Justice wrote:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While it may often be the part of wisdom to approach
individuals or an audience from a standpoint of current knowledge, it
should never be overlooked that the Revelation of the Manifestation
of God is the standard for all knowledge, and scientific statements
and theories, no matter how close they may come to the eternal
principles proclaimed by God’s Messenger, are in their very
nature ephemeral and limited. Likewise, attempting to make the Bahá’í
Faith relevant to modern society is to incur the grave risk of
compromising the fundamental verities of our Faith in an effort to
make it conform to current theories and practices.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principal concern of the House of Justice is over a
methodological bias and discordant tone which seem to inform the work
of certain of the authors. The impression given is that, in
attempting to achieve what they understand to be academic
objectivity, they have inadvertently cast the Faith into a mould
which is essentially foreign to its nature, taking no account of the
spiritual forces which Bahá’ís see as its
foundation. Presumably the justification offered for this approach
would be that most scholars of comparative religion are essentially
concerned with discernable phenomena, observable events and practical
affairs and are used to treating their subject from a western, if not
a Christian, viewpoint. This approach, although understandable, is
quite impossible for a Bahá’í, for it ignores the
fact that our world-view includes the spiritual dimension as an
indispensable component for consistency and coherence, and it does
not beseem a Bahá’í to write ... about his Faith
as if he looked upon it from the norm of humanism or materialism.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other words, we are presented in such articles with
the spectacle of Bahá’ís trying to write as if
they were non-Bahá’ís. This leads to these
authors’ drawing conclusions and making implications which are
in conflict with Bahá’í teachings and with the
reality of the Faith. A good Bahá’í author, when
writing for such a publication, should be fully capable of adopting a
calmly neutral and expository tone, without falling into the trap of
distorting the picture by adopting what is, in essence, a
materialistic and localized stance.</p>
